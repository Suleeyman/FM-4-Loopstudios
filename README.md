## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Implement a background on images, a "`mask`".

```css
.mask {
  background: linear-gradient(270deg, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0001) 0%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.601863) 100%);
}
```
Also learned how to make a bit more advanced hover effects with `clip-path` CSS property with ::after pseudo-element.

```css
.galerie .see-all::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  background-color: #000;
  clip-path: circle(0% at 15% 50%);
  transition: 0.3s linear;
  z-index: -1;
}

.galerie .see-all:hover {
  color: white;
}

.galerie .see-all:hover::after {
  clip-path: circle(120% at 15% 50%);
}
```
Moreover, this challenge has involved me to use `display: grid;`, and I tried my best with.
